# PQR_files
A PQR (or Position, charge (Q), and Radius) file is a protein data bank (PDB) file with the temperature and occupancy columns 
replaced by columns containing the per-atom charge (Q) and radius (R) using the pdb2pqr software. PQR files are used in several computational biology packages, including APBS. We use the data from the PQR file as the molecular charge density function for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE). Note that we obtained some of these files directly from the APBS software package test examples.
